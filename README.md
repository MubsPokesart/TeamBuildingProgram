### 1v1 Program: Version 1.0

The goal of this project is to create a beta version of ryyjyywyy's 1v1 teambuilding program from Gen 7 and Early Gen 8 utilizing python's list mechanics.

I plan on working on specific functions of this program step by step in a way to optimize this running as best as possible. 


**Main Goals: will mark as DONE when done.**
>- Creating a sample matchups sheet that is easily importable to this program. [DONE]
>- Working on making a file based system for decided the generation used for the program here. This will keep track of 3 lists: The full matchups list, and two parallel ones; mon ID's (metagross_1, etc) and their random.random IDs to better keep track of duplicate entries and teams. [DONE]
>- Start working on a nested for loop system to brute force every single combination, given that combination wasn't already done, didn't violate species clause. [Working on Species Clause]
>- This nested for loop system will be utilized in the menu, whether a situation needs 1, 2, or 3 for loops depends on the amount of mons the user gives.[Done, though 3 for loops takes an unreasonable amount of time.]
>- Optimize as much as possible to decrease time to do this. [WIP]
>- Getting the whole thing up and running effectively [Done]
